      <p>An absolute url contains ALL the data needed to locate a reousrce, while a relative url uses an absolute url as one piece of its data which it uses to locate the target. An absolute url, like my first one, contains the entire HHTPS adress of the target. For my relative url, since it is already within my project folder/root domain, I only need to link the name of the file. </p>

      <p>Pseudo-classes can react to user input and various states that an element might be in, unlike regular CSS. For intance, if a user enters an invalid email into an email entry field, you can use :invalid to turn the entry box red, or whatever else you want it to do.  </p>

  <div class="box-more2" style="height: 400px; width: 600px; border: 5 px solid"></div> <p>The background-position function moved the image left or right within the frame. The background-size:200px function repeated the image 6 times, with the top row of images being cropped and the bottom row being full height. Both rows are the same width. The background-repeat didn't seem to make a noticeable difference.  </p>

The background-size:200px function repeated the image 6 times, with the top row of images being cropped and the bottom row being full height. Both rows are the same width. The background-repeat didn't seem to make a noticeable difference. To be honest, I don't undertand why. </p>

  <h3>Prompt 30</h3>
     
 <div class="box-more5" style="height: 400px; width: 600px; margin: 100px"></div> <p>This code has more parts than my first one, because the shadow is a more complex element with different attributes.</p>

 <p class="invisible-ink2"><span>ADFGHJKMJHGFDS</span> <span>ASDFGHJKJHGFDS</span> <span>I wanna take a nap</span></p>
    
    <p> the transition: color rule makes the color-changing effect I added to the text appear 500ms slower than it would appear without that rule. It is a very subtle, but noticeable difference. </p>

  <h3>Prompt 35</h3>
     
<img class="filter" src="starry_ceiling.jpg">
    
<p>Filter adds photoshop-like filters to image, for instance, I changed the colors of mine to make it a bit sepia-toned. The mix-blend mode can combine multiple layers on the image (like an overlay) and also add multiple lighting effects.</p>
